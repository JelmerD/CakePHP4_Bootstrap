# CakePHP 4.x bootstrap

Basic bootstrap I use for my projects

## Howto

- Clone this project into the directory you want to do stuff
- Open git bash, type `vagrant up`
- This should install everything and finally give you some instructions
- After installation you should be able to remove the `Installation.sh` including the line invoking that file from the VagrantFile
