# CakePHP 4.x bootstrap

Basic bootstrap I use for my projects

## Howto

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/JelmerD/CakePHP4_Bootstrap.git <directory>`
1. Run `vagrant up`
1. when you run into the message saying something like `No CakePHP project installed so we need to do some stuff..`
Then you have to make sure to follow those instructions.

4. After installation, you should be able to remove the `vagrant/Installation.sh` including the line invoking that file from the VagrantFile
